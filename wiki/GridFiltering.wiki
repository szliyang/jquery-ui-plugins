= Filtering Grid Data =
The grid comes with several built-in filter types for filtering various types of data. Column filters are defined as part of the column definition using the [GridColumnConfiguration#filter filter] attribute. These filters render a filter field in the column header where the user enters data and rows are dynamically filtered out as the filter value changes. It is important to note that rows are filtered out based on column values (i.e. the row object's attribute values), not necessarily what is displayed in the column since the value displayed can be different than the actual row attribute value based on the formatter that is assigned to the column. 

== Built-in text filters ==
There are four built-in text filters. These filters render a text field at the top of the column and filter out rows as the user types in the text field by matching column values with what is typed in the filter. The rules regarding what rows are filtered out depend on the type of filter declared on the column definition.  Valid filter types are "contains", "doesNotContain", "startsWith" and "endsWith". To use one of these filters simply assign the desired filter type string to the column's filter option.
